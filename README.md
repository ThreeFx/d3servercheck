# d3servercheck

Program to check if your D3 is connected to a known good/bad server.

There was a [bug in D3 Season 21 (at least on EU) which meant that some servers did not submit
player's clears to the D3
leaderboards](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/d3/t/gr-150-cleared-but-not-recorded-04082020/2170/143).
This script polls your D3 connections and tells you whether you are connected to
a known GOOD or BAD server.

## Windows

### Enable PowerShell execution

In order to run this script you have to allow local PowerShell scripts to run.
To do this: Open a PowerShell as Administrator and then enter:

    C:> Set-ExecutionPolicy remotesigned -scope process
    
When prompted if you want to change the policy, enter `Y` and press enter.

Note: This may be a high risk if you are prone to fishing/social engineering
attacks. **Do this at your own risk!**

## Running the program

### Both MacOS and Windows

Download a ZIP archive of this repository (top-right "Code", and then "Download
ZIP"). Unpack it.

### Windows

Then right-click `d3servercheck.ps1` and then `Run PowerShell script`. If you
cannot run this script check if you did the previous step correctly.

### MacOS

Open a terminal (you should be able to search for "Terminal" in Spotlight),
and then navigate to the folder where you unpacked the game. Alternatively
navigate to the folder you unpacked in Finder and then use the Top Bar:
**Finder** -> **Services** -> **New Terminal at Folder**. Then run the
script like this:

```
./d3servercheck.sh
```

### Both OSes

You do not have to start Diablo 3 before starting this program, it will
automatically pick up on the game's connections. When running successfully
you should see output like this:

```

```

## Adding servers

You can add servers by adding their IP and the fact whether they are good or bad to
[`servers.csv`](https://github.com/ThreeFx/d3servercheck/tree/master/servers.csv). The
file is in CSV format, meaning "comma-separated values". To append a new server
simply add

```
<YOUR_SERVER_IP>,good
```

if the server is good, or

```
<YOUR_SERVER_IP>,bad
```

if it is bad.

request directly.

## FAQ

### What about support for MacOS?

The current script works only for Windows. I don't have a Mac or a BSD-device to
test on and I also have exams next week, so I won't be able to support Macs in
the near future. Hopefully I won't need to and the bug will be fixed soon. If
not pull requests are welcome!
